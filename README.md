## Setup

- build: `uv venv && uv pip install -e .` or `uv build` in short.
- setup zendesk credentials in `.env` file, refer to [.env.example](.env.example).
- configure in Claude desktop:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
      "zendesk": {
          "command": "uv",
          "args": [
              "--directory",
              "/path/to/zendesk-mcp-server",
              "run",
              "zendesk"
          ]
      }
  }
}
```

## Features

### Multi-Language Support

**Features:**
- All knowledge base tools (`search_kb_articles`, `get_kb_article`, `get_section_articles`) support locale parameter
- Article URLs are automatically updated to match the requested locale (e.g., `/hc/en-us/articles/123` → `/hc/zh-cn/articles/123`)
- Article responses include a `locale` field showing the content language
- Cache is locale-aware to prevent cross-language cache pollution

**Example:**
```python
# Search articles in Chinese
search_kb_articles(query="密码重置", locale="zh-cn")

# Get article in English
get_kb_article(article_id=123456, locale="en-us")
```

### Attachment Handling

The server provides flexible attachment handling with two modes:

**Option 1: Manual (token-efficient)**
1. Call `get_ticket_comments(ticket_id)` to see attachment metadata
2. Identify relevant attachments by checking `is_image` flag and `content_type`
3. Call `get_attachment(attachment_id)` to view/download specific files

**Option 2: Automatic inline images**
1. Call `get_ticket_comments(ticket_id, include_inline_images=true)`
2. All image attachments are automatically fetched and displayed

The manual mode is recommended for tickets with many attachments, while automatic mode is best for tickets with few images where visual context is essential.

### Macros

The server supports Zendesk macros for automated ticket workflows:

- **Search and discover macros** by keywords or title
- **View complete macro configurations** including all actions and restrictions
- **Apply macros to tickets** to automate common actions (status changes, canned responses, field updates, etc.)

Macros are useful for:
- Standardizing responses to common issues
- Automating repetitive ticket workflows
- Applying consistent ticket categorization and routing
- Ensuring compliance with team procedures
